\# Day 1 - Introduction to Cloud Computing



\## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.



\## Key Benefits of Cloud Computing:

\- \*\*Scalability\*\* – Quickly scale resources up or down based on demand.

\- \*\*Cost Efficiency\*\* – Pay only for what you use.

\- \*\*Performance\*\* – High-speed performance with global data centers.

\- \*\*Security\*\* – Built-in security and compliance controls.

\- \*\*Availability\*\* – Access services from anywhere, anytime.



\## Service Models:

\- \*\*IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)\*\*  

&nbsp; Examples: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine  

&nbsp; You manage: OS, apps, data  

&nbsp; Provider manages: infrastructure



\- \*\*PaaS (Platform as a Service)\*\*  

&nbsp; Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine  

&nbsp; You manage: apps and data  

&nbsp; Provider manages: OS and infrastructure



\- \*\*SaaS (Software as a Service)\*\*

\## Top Cloud Providers:

\- \*\*Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*\*

\- \*\*Microsoft Azure\*\*

\- \*\*Google Cloud Platform (GCP)\*\*
