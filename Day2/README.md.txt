 What I Learned

### ☁ Cloud Computing Deep Dive

**Service Models:**

- **IaaS** (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs): Offers virtual machines and infrastructure.
- **PaaS** (e.g., Heroku, Google App Engine): Provides platforms for app development.
- **SaaS** (e.g., Gmail, Google Docs): Ready-to-use software over the internet.

 Virtualization vs Containerization

**Virtualization:**

- Uses hypervisors to create multiple virtual machines (VMs)
- Each VM has its own OS and resources

**Containerization:**

- Lightweight alternative to VMs
- Shares host OS, runs isolated applications
- Popular tools: Docker, Kubernetes
- Ideal for DevOps and CI/CD workflows

 DevOps Basics

- **DevOps** = Development + Operations
- Aims to bridge the gap between developers and IT operations

**Core Concepts:**

- **CI/CD** (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Tools like Terraform, Ansible
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Tools like Prometheus, Grafana
- **Automation:** Shell scripting (Bash), Python, YAML
