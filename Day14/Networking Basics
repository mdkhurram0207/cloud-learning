Day 15 â€“ Networking Basics

ðŸ”¹ What is Networking?

Simple: Networking means connecting computers, servers, and devices so they can talk to each other and share data.

Example: When you open netflix.com, your laptop connects to Netflixâ€™s servers over the internet.


 OSI Model (7 Layers)

Think of it like a postal system (step-by-step delivery).

1. Physical â€“ cables, WiFi, signals.
Wires carrying bits (0s and 1s).


2. Data Link â€“ switches, MAC addresses.
Post office worker sorting letters.


3. Network â€“ IP addresses, routers.
The GPS deciding the delivery route.


4. Transport â€“ TCP/UDP.
Ensures delivery is complete (TCP) or fast (UDP).

5. Session â€“ session management.
Opening/closing a phone call.


6. Presentation â€“ data format, encryption.
Translating languages or encoding/decoding.


7. Application â€“ HTTP, DNS, FTP, SSH.
The app you see: Netflix, Gmail, browser.



In practice, Cloud/DevOps focuses most on Layers 3â€“7.


ðŸ”¹ TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

Ensures data is reliable, ordered, and complete.

Uses 3-way handshake before communication.

Used for: websites (HTTP/HTTPS), emails (SMTP), file transfers (FTP).


ðŸ‘‰ Like sending a package with tracking.



ðŸ”¹ IP (Internet Protocol)

Assigns addresses to devices (IPv4/IPv6).

Responsible for routing data across networks.

Example: 192.168.1.5 (private), 142.250.185.46 (Google server).

ðŸ”¹ Subnet

Subnet = smaller network inside a bigger network.

Helps organize and secure traffic.

Example:

Office LAN: 192.168.1.0/24

Servers subnet: 192.168.1.0 â€“ 192.168.1.127

Users subnet: 192.168.1.128 â€“ 192.168.1.255


In Cloud (AWS/GCP): You create VPCs and divide them into subnets (public for web servers, private for databases).


ðŸ”¹ Putting It All Together

When you visit netflix.com:

1. IP finds Netflixâ€™s server address.


2. TCP ensures all video packets arrive correctly.


3. Subnet decides if your request comes from home WiFi or office network.

4. OSI model layers process your request step by step until the video plays.
