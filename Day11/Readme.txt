Day 11 - LVM and Mounting

Today I learned about LVM (Logical Volume Manager) in Linux using my EBS volumes.
I practiced both the theory and the commands step by step.

ðŸ”¹ What I Learned in Theory
1. EBS Volumes

EBS (Elastic Block Store) is like a hard disk attached to my EC2 instance.

I created 4 volumes (10GB, 12GB, 14GB, â€¦).

2. Why LVM?

Normally each disk is separate. LVM lets me:

Combine multiple disks into one pool.

Create partitions (Logical Volumes) inside that pool.

Expand storage later by adding more disks.

Manage storage flexibly.

3. Layers of LVM

Physical Volume (PV) â†’ A disk marked for LVM use.
Volume Group (VG) â†’ A pool made from one or more PVs.
Logical Volume (LV) â†’ A slice of the VG, which I can use like a normal partition.

4. Filesystem

Without a filesystem, storage is just raw space.
Filesystem (like ext4) organizes files so they can be stored and read.

5. Mounting

Mounting means attaching a storage device to a folder.
Example: If I mount at /mnt/data, all files I save there go to my Logical Volume.

ðŸ”¹ Commands I Practiced
1. Check available disks
lsblk

2. Create Physical Volumes (PVs)
sudo pvcreate /dev/xvdf /dev/xvdg

3. Create a Volume Group (VG) from 10GB + 12GB
sudo vgcreate vg_gp /dev/xvdf /dev/xvdg

4. Create a Logical Volume (LV) of 10GB from the VG
sudo lvcreate -n lv_data -L 10G vg_gp

5. Make a filesystem on the LV
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg_gp/lv_data

6. Mount the LV to a folder
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/data
sudo mount /dev/vg_gp/lv_data /mnt/data

7. Verify the mount
df -h /mnt/data

ðŸ”¹ Verification Commands

pvs â†’ show Physical Volumes
vgs â†’ show Volume Groups
lvs â†’ show Logical Volumes
lsblk â†’ show block devices
df -h â†’ show mounted filesystems

ðŸ”¹ Summary of My Learning

EBS volumes = raw storage.
LVM = combines disks into a flexible pool.
PV â†’ VG â†’ LV = the structure of LVM.
Filesystem (ext4) makes the LV usable.
Mounting connects LV to a folder like /mnt/data.


I successfully created a 10GB Logical Volume from a 22GB pool (10GB + 12GB EBS).
