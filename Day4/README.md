&nbsp;What I Did Today



\- Practiced more Linux commands

\- Learned how to:

&nbsp; - Move (`mv`) and copy (`cp`) files

&nbsp; - Use `cat`, `echo`, and `grep`

\- Set up Day 4 folder and pushed it to GitHub





&nbsp;Useful Commands



```bash

mv file.txt newfolder/     # Move file

cp file.txt copy.txt       # Copy file

cat file.txt               # Show file contents

echo "Hello" > file.txt    # Write to file

grep "text" file.txt       # Search inside file
