Day 4 â€“ More Linux + Cloud Prep

 What I Did Today

- Practiced more Linux commands
- Got comfortable navigating folders
- Learned how to:
  - Move (`mv`) and copy (`cp`) files
  - Use `cat`, `echo`, and `grep`
- Set up Day 4 folder and pushed it to GitHub

 Useful Commands

```bash
mv file.txt newfolder/     # Move file
cp file.txt copy.txt       # Copy file
cat file.txt               # Show file contents
echo "Hello" > file.txt    # Write to file
grep "text" file.txt       # Search inside file
